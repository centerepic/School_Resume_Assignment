            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a motivated and skilled computer programmer with experience in languages such as HTML/CSS, Luau, and Python. I have been running my own small online business for the past few months, where I have provided a scripting service to over 100 customers. I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages, and I am confident in my ability to adapt to new environments and challenges. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with technology and developing my own projects. I am looking for a position where I can use my skills and passion to make a positive impact and grow as a professional.</p>
